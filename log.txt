14:20 - made a couple plotly graphs to have a look, now opting for a streamlit dashboard to see how it compares


15:00 - worked on a streamlit dashboard, complete with funnel view, detailed step analysis, drop out reason tab. purpose is to make data easily processable by product teams, while still giving some granular access (data row view)

15:30 cleaned up repo

16:00 investigated potential performance issues, most likely due to streamlit reload issue (stopping time and reloading time). assessed this wouldn't be a problem to users.
