- each event is a user action
- both user id and session id
  - use session id to identify session patterns (user path)
  - use user id to identify repeat buyers

- Objectives :
  - How do users navigate ?
  - What problems do they encounter ?
  - What patterns emerge ?



-> why did i use what I used ?
-> python is simple and quick to work with data analysis, especially with pandas. would go for polars if performance was an issue. plotly is good for simple graph, streamlit simple for interactive diagrams

-> I went for a quick dashboard visualization approach, because for internal users (product team), all that matters is quick, key insights. Solution implies installing the app and running it in the terminal ; I would fix this by hosting it somewhere, and letting my product team access it from an internal url. There is only one session file currently, but multiple can be selected, and I would either allow users to upload their own, or automate data capture pipelinest to automatically upload them on the filesystem where my app runs.

-> steps (add commands):
  - install uv / python
  - download s3 file
  - run app with uv run command (should take you to browser, otherwise go to localhost:8501)
